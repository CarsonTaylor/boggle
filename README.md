# BOGGLE
This project allows the user to play boggle on any size boggle board.

## Getting Started
If you are on a unix system, run the loadDict.sh bash script with the command

```
$ bash loadDict.sh
```
to build the dictionary file.  If for some reason this doesn't work you can download an alternative dictionary file from here
